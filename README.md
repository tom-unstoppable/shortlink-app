# ShortLink - URL Shortening Service

A URL shortening service built with Ruby, Sinatra, and Redis that converts long URLs into short, manageable links.

> **Note**: This project started as a learning exercise with Sinatra and evolved into a full-featured URL shortener.

## 🚀 Live Demo

**Your ShortLink service is now live and ready for testing!**

🌐 **Demo URL**: [https://shortlink-app-4oyj.onrender.com/](https://shortlink-app-4oyj.onrender.com/)

> **⚠️ Note**: If clicking the demo link returns a 403 error, try one of these alternatives:
> - **Copy and paste** the URL directly into your browser: `https://shortlink-app-4oyj.onrender.com/`
> - **Click in browser address bar** and press Enter
> - **Use the curl commands** below for testing

> **💤 Service Note**: As this app runs on Render's free service, it may go to sleep after periods of inactivity. When you reaccess the link, it will automatically wake up and start again, but this can take up to a minute to get back online. Please be patient during the initial response.

## Security Analysis

### Identified Attack Vectors

1. **URL Injection Attacks**
   - **Risk**: Malicious URLs could redirect users to phishing sites, malware, or inappropriate content
   - **Mitigation**: 
     - URL format validation using `URI.regexp`
     - Consider implementing URL reputation checking
     - Add content scanning for known malicious domains
     - Implement user reporting mechanism

2. **Short Code Enumeration**
   - **Risk**: Attackers could systematically guess short codes to discover private URLs
   - **Mitigation**: 
     - 6-character alphanumeric codes provide 56+ billion combinations
     - Rate limiting on decode attempts
     - Consider implementing longer codes for sensitive URLs
     - Monitor for suspicious access patterns

3. **Denial of Service (DoS)**
   - **Risk**: High-frequency requests could overwhelm the service
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Implement rate limiting per IP address
     - Redis connection pooling
     - Request size limits
     - Consider implementing CAPTCHA for suspicious traffic

4. **Redis Security**
   - **Risk**: Unauthorized access to Redis instance could expose all URL mappings
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Redis authentication (`requirepass`)
     - Network isolation (bind to localhost)
     - Redis ACLs for fine-grained permissions
     - Regular security updates

5. **Information Disclosure**
   - **Risk**: Error messages might reveal system information
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Generic error messages in live environments
     - Proper logging without sensitive data exposure
     - Input sanitization in error responses

6. **Cache Poisoning**
   - **Risk**: Malicious actors could modify cached data
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Redis AUTH and encrypted connections
     - Data integrity checks
     - Regular cache validation

### Security Recommendations

- Implement comprehensive rate limiting
- Add URL reputation and safety checking
- Use HTTPS for secure connections
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Monitor and log all access attempts
- Implement proper authentication for admin operations

## Scalability Analysis

### Current Implementation Strengths

1. **Redis Performance**
   - **Advantage**: Sub-millisecond response times
   - **Capacity**: 100,000+ requests/second per instance
   - **Memory Efficiency**: ~100 bytes per URL mapping

2. **Collision Handling**
   - **Current**: Linear retry on collision detection
   - **Capacity**: 56+ billion combinations with 6-character codes
   - **Collision Rate**: ~0.00000002% for first million URLs

### Scalability Challenges & Solutions

#### 1. Short Code Collision Problem

**Challenge**: As URL count grows, collision probability increases

**Solutions**:
```ruby
# Dynamic length scaling
def generate_short_code
  total_urls = @redis.dbsize
  length = case total_urls
           when 0..1_000_000 then 6      # 56B combinations
           when 1_000_001..100_000_000 then 7  # 3.5T combinations  
           else 8                         # 218T combinations
           end
  
  SecureRandom.alphanumeric(length).upcase
end

# Alternative: Base62 encoding with counters
def generate_sequential_code
  counter = @redis.incr("url_counter")
  Base62.encode(counter)
end
```

#### 2. Database Scaling

**Current Limitation**: Single Redis instance

**Horizontal Scaling Solutions**:
```ruby
# Redis Cluster configuration
redis_config = {
  cluster: [
    "redis://node1:6379",
    "redis://node2:6379", 
    "redis://node3:6379"
  ]
}

# Consistent hashing for URL distribution
def get_redis_node(short_code)
  node_index = short_code.hash % REDIS_NODES.length
  REDIS_NODES[node_index]
end
```

#### 3. Application Scaling

**Horizontal Application Scaling**:
- Load balancer (nginx, HAProxy)
- Multiple Sinatra instances
- Docker container orchestration
- Auto-scaling based on traffic

**Caching Strategy**:
```ruby
# Multi-layer caching
class UrlMapping
  def self.decode_with_cache(short_code)
    # L1: Application memory cache
    cached = APP_CACHE.get(short_code)
    return cached if cached
    
    # L2: Redis cache
    mapping = find_by_code(short_code)
    if mapping
      APP_CACHE.set(short_code, mapping["original_url"], 3600)
      mapping["original_url"]
    end
  end
end
```

#### 4. Geographic Distribution

**CDN Integration**:
- Geographic URL routing
- Edge caching for popular URLs
- Regional Redis clusters

## Technical Implementation

**Language**: Ruby 3.4+  
**Framework**: Sinatra  
**Database**: Redis  
**Testing**: RSpec  
**Containerization**: Docker  

This implementation prioritizes simplicity, performance, and maintainability while addressing security and scalability concerns through documented approaches and architectural considerations.

## Lessons Learned & Challenges

### What Went Well
- **Redis choice**: Perfect for high-read, low-write patterns with sub-millisecond response times. The key-value model maps directly to our short_code → original_url lookup, and TTL prevents unbounded growth. Redis's in-memory nature gives us that sweet, sweet speed!
- **Sinatra simplicity**: Perfect for a focused API like this - no over-engineering here!
- **Docker integration**: Made development environment consistent across all machines

### Challenges Faced
- **Collision handling**: Had to think through the math of short code generation - probability theory became my friend!
- **URL validation edge cases**: Handling malformed URLs, international domains, and various URL schemes required careful regex and URI parsing
- **Redis connection management**: Ensuring proper connection pooling and handling Redis connection failures gracefully
- **Performance tuning**: Getting those sub-millisecond response times took some Redis optimization magic

### Future Improvements I'd Like to Make
- Add user authentication for private URLs
- Implement URL analytics dashboard
- Add bulk URL import/export
- Consider using a more sophisticated collision resolution algorithm
- Add rate limiting and abuse prevention

### What I Learned About Myself
- **I'm a performance enthusiast**: I kept checking Redis response times and got excited when I saw sub-millisecond results
- **I love elegant solutions**: Redis + Sinatra just clicked for me - simple but powerful
- **I enjoy the math behind the code**: The collision probability stuff was actually fun to figure out
- **I'm detail-oriented**: I kept finding edge cases in URL validation and had to fix them all

### What I'd Do Differently Next Time
- **Start with Docker from day one**: I wasted so much time with "works on my machine" issues before finally setting up Docker
- **Write tests as I code**: I wrote most tests after the fact - TDD would have saved me from some bugs
- **Plan the data model more carefully**: I had to refactor the Redis keys a couple times as I figured out what I actually needed
- **Document as I go**: I made some decisions early on that I forgot why I made them
